# 8.2.16 project control sow combination

Default weight templates for SOW stage combinations (defines how to calculate SOW progress)

| Field | Data Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| _id | String | Primary key (ObjectId as string) |
| combination | String | Combination identifier (sample: "manufacturing_delivery", "manufacturing_coating_delivery") |
| data | Object | Stage weight configuration object |
| data.manufacturing | Object | Manufacturing stage configuration |
| data.manufacturing.weight | Number | Manufacturing weight percentage (sample: 60, 80) |
| data.coating | Object, undefined | Coating stage configuration (if applicable) |
| data.coating.weight | Number, undefined | Coating weight percentage (sample: 20) |
| data.delivery | Object | Delivery stage configuration |
| data.delivery.weight | Number | Delivery weight percentage (sample: 20) |
| last_status | String | Last review status (sample: "unreviewed") |
| is_reviewed | Boolean | Review completion flag (true/false) |
| is_value_changed | Boolean | Value change flag (true/false) |
| created_at | Date | Creation timestamp (ISODate) |
| created_by | String, null | Creator user email or null |
| updated_at | Date | Last update timestamp (ISODate) |
| updated_by | String, null | Last updater user email or null |

## Notes

- This collection stores **default weight templates** initialized once per project
- Defines how different production stages (manufacturing, coating, delivery) are weighted when calculating overall SOW progress
- Two standard combinations:
  - **`manufacturing_delivery`**: Manufacturing 80%, Delivery 20%
  - **`manufacturing_coating_delivery`**: Manufacturing 60%, Coating 20%, Delivery 20%
- These weights are used by the progress calculation engine to determine how much each stage contributes to overall SOW completion
- Can be customized per project through the `is_reviewed` workflow
