| Field | Data Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| _id | String | Primary key (ObjectId as string) |
| id_sow | String | SOW reference (ObjectId as string) |
| total_price | Number | SOW total price/value (sample: 1482.75, 17237.12) |
| weight | Number | Calculated weight percentage based on SOW value relative to total project value (sample: 5, 12, range: 0-100, sum must equal 100) |
| last_status | String | Review status (sample: "unreviewed", "reviewed") |
| is_reviewed | Boolean | Review completion flag (true/false) |

## Notes

- This collection calculates **weighted progress** for the project control dashboard
- Each SOW's `weight` is calculated as: `ceil(sow_total_price / project_total_value * 100)`
- Weights are automatically adjusted to ensure the sum equals exactly 100%
- Used to calculate overall project progress where larger-value SOWs have proportionally more impact
- Regenerated when SOW values change or when project control is initialized
