# 8.2.17 job_lockers

Distributed lock mechanism for jobs

| Field | Data Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| _id | ObjectId | Primary key, auto-generated unique identifier |
| created_at | Date | Lock creation timestamp (ISODate) |
| created_by | Mixed | User reference for creation (typically null for system jobs) |
| db_access | String | Database access identifier/tenant (sample: "rosmari-25-08-2023") |
| key | String | Lock key identifier (sample: "sow_progress_chart", "vessel_tracking") |
| updated_at | Date | Last update timestamp (ISODate) |
| updated_by | Mixed | User reference for last update (typically null) |
| job_id | ObjectId | Reference to the associated job document |

**Note**: This collection implements distributed locking to prevent concurrent execution of the same job. The `key` field identifies the type of job being locked, while `db_access` ensures locks are tenant-specific in multi-tenant environments.
