# 8.2.12 counters

Global auto-increment counters for generating unique sequential values across entire system

| Field | Data Type | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| _id | ObjectId | Primary key, auto-generated unique identifier |
| type | String | Counter type identifier (sample: "LINE", "PIPE", "ITEM") |
| seq | Integer | Current sequence number (auto-incremented with each use) |
| created_at | Date | Counter creation timestamp (ISODate) |
| updated_at | Date | Last increment timestamp (ISODate) |
| updated_by | String | Email of user who last incremented the counter |

**Note**: Each counter type maintains its own sequence. The `seq` field is atomically incremented to ensure unique sequential numbers are generated across distributed operations.
