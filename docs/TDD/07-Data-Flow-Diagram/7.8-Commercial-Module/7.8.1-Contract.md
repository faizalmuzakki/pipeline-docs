*Figure: Contract - Data Flow Diagram Level 0*

This diagram represents the Contract process, which manages contract documents and metadata. An Authorized User creates a new contract entry by providing document number, document name, description, tags, and attached file. The system processes this data in the Contract module and stores the information in the contract data store (D1).

Once stored, the system can generate and return contract documents to the user, making them available for viewing and download. This process supports contract management by ensuring all contract documents are properly documented, organized with searchable metadata, and accessible for project stakeholders to reference throughout the project lifecycle.
