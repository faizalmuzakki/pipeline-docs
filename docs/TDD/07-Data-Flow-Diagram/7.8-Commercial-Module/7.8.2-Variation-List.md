This diagram represents the Variation List process, which manages variation order documents and metadata. An Authorized User creates a new variation entry by providing variation number, description, date, document name, attached file, and status. The system processes this data in the Variation module and stores the information in the variation data store (D1).

Once stored, the system can generate and return variation documents to the user, making them available for viewing and download. This process supports variation management by ensuring all contract variations and change orders are properly documented, tracked with status updates, and accessible for project stakeholders to reference for contract modifications.
