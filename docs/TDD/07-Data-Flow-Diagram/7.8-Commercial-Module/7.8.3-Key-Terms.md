This diagram represents the Key Terms process, which manages important contract terms and conditions. An Authorized User creates a new key term entry by providing key term name, information type, and key term value. The system processes this data in the Key Terms module and stores the information in the key_terms data store (D1).

Once stored, the system can generate and return key terms information to the user, making them available for reference. This process supports contract management by ensuring critical contract terms and conditions are properly documented with structured name-value pairs and accessible for project stakeholders to reference throughout the contract lifecycle.
