*Figure: General - Data Flow Diagram Level 0*

This diagram represents the General process, which manages general documentation and metadata. An Authorized User creates a new general document entry by providing document number, name, date, description, tags, and attached file. The system processes this data in the General module and stores the information in the general data store (D1).

Once stored, the system can generate and return general documents to the user, making them available for viewing and download. This process supports documentation management by ensuring all general project documents are properly documented, organized with searchable metadata (doc number, name, date, description, tags), and accessible for project stakeholders to reference throughout the project lifecycle.
