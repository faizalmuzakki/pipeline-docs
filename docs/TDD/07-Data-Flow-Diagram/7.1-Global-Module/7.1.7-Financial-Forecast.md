This diagram illustrates the Financial Forecast process in Tubestream Pipeline, showing how data flows between authorized users and the system. The process begins when **Authorized Users** make changes that affect project progress financially (such as SOW delivery schedule updates, pricing changes, or quantity adjustments). The system processes these changes in the Financial Forecast module and updates the financial forecast data in the forecast_dates data store (D1).

The system provides financial forecast information back to authorized users through the financial forecast list view, showing projected revenue and delivery schedules based on SOW data. This enables financial planning and analysis by automatically calculating forecasts from project progress data.
