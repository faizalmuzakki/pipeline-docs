This diagram illustrates the Global Dashboard process in Tubestream Pipeline, showing how data flows between users and the system. The **Authorized User** accesses the dashboard to view assigned projects based on their role and permissions.

The Dashboard process serves as the main entry point after login, providing an overview of all accessible projects. It displays project lists with active/closed project counts and S-curve data for progress visualization. Users also can navigate to specific project modules. The dashboard ensures role-based project visibility so users only see projects they have access to.
