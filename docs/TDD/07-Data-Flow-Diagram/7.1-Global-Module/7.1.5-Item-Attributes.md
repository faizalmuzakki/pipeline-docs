*Figure: Item Attributes - Data Flow Diagram Level 0*

This diagram illustrates the Item Attributes Management process in Tubestream Pipeline, showing how data flows between the Super Admin and the system. The process begins when the **Super Admin** edits item attribute definitions by providing attribute information (label, description, type, and values). The system processes this data in the Item Attributes module and stores the attribute information in the item_attributes data store (D1).

The system provides item attributes information back to the Super Admin through the item attributes list view. These global item attributes (e.g: Grade, Supplementary, Delivery Condition) are used to standardize material specifications across all projects, supporting different attribute types (Single Selection, Multiple Selection, Numeric) for consistent data entry and reporting.
