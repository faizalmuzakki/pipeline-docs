This diagram illustrates the Item Management process in Tubestream Pipeline Setup Module, showing how data flows between authorized users and the system. The process begins when **Authorized Users** bulk create, create, or edit project-specific items by providing item specifications (OD, grade, etc.). The system processes this data in the Item module and stores the item data in the item data store (D1).

When users attempt to delete an item, the system validates item usage by checking if the item is used in any SOW. If the item is in use, deletion fails and the user receives a failure notification. If the item is not used, deletion succeeds. The system provides item information back to authorized users through the item list view.

This process supports proper item catalog management by managing project-specific item specifications, supporting bulk creation for efficient setup, validating item deletion to prevent breaking SOW references, storing item data with complete specifications (OD, grade, connection type, etc.), and maintaining the item catalog accessible through the item database.
