This diagram illustrates the Material Deviation Report (MDR) process in Tubestream Pipeline, showing how data flows between users and the system. The **Authorized User** creates and manages MDRs for tracking non-conformances, deviations, and quality issues.

The MDR process ensures proper quality issue tracking by receiving user inputs, validating deviation data, updating records with MDR details (number, description, deviation type, severity, affected lots, root cause analysis, corrective actions), and providing notifications to stakeholders. The system supports complete MDR workflow including creation, review, approval, and closure with status tracking. MDR records are linked to specific lots for traceability, and email notifications are sent when MDRs are created, updated, or require approval, ensuring seamless quality management workflows.
