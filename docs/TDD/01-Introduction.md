# 1. Introduction

The Technical Design Document serves as a comprehensive guide outlining the system architecture and implementation details. It provides a structured framework for developers, architects, and stakeholders to understand the technical aspects of the MCMS Linepipe project.

This document includes **server configuration**, which details the specifications and setup of the server, including cloud, database, authentication, logging, and API configurations. It also defines **coding standards**, outlining best practices and conventions for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code, such as naming conventions, indentation rules, error handling, and documentation standards.

Another key aspect is **interaction protocols**, which describe the communication methods between different system components. The **component design diagram** provides a visual representation of system modules and their interactions, illustrating how different components work together to achieve the desired functionality.

Additionally, the document includes a **list of API endpoints**, specifying available APIs and HTTP methods. The **data flow diagram (DFD)** illustrates how data moves within the system, from user inputs to processing and data storage, ensuring clarity in data processing and transformation. Lastly, the **database collections** section defines database collections and tables used for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
