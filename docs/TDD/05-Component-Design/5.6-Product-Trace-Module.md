## Summary

The Product Trace Module provides end-to-end traceability across four components:

1. **Traceability Matrix** - Complete lineage from SOW → Work Order → Heat → Length → Inspection → Transfer
2. **Heat Number Tracking** - Heat-level tracking with material certificates and test results
3. **Pipe Tagging & Identification** - Unique pipe identification with QR codes and serial numbers
4. **Location Tracking** - Real-time location tracking across manufacturing, storage, and transit

**Key Features:**
- Complete genealogy tracking (SOW → WO → Heat → Length → Pipe → Location)
- Heat number and material certificate linking
- Pipe tagging with QR codes and barcodes
- Location history (mill → yard → vessel → destination)
- Real-time inventory by location
- Traceability reports for regulatory compliance
