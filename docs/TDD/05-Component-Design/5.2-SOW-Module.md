# 5.2 SOW Module

The SOW (Scope of Work) Module manages contract line items and manufacturing order definitions for linepipe projects. It serves as the foundational module that defines what items need to be manufactured, their specifications, quantities, and associated vendors. SOW records are the starting point for all downstream processes including work orders, inspections, MDR tracking, and progress monitoring.

## Summary

The SOW Module provides critical contract and manufacturing management capabilities across four major components:

1. **SOW List & Management** - Comprehensive listing, filtering, and searching of scope of work items with progress tracking
2. **SOW Creation & Editing** - Form-based creation and editing of SOW records with item attributes, specifications, quantities, and pricing
3. **SOW Detail & Progress** - Detailed view of SOW items with work order associations, inspection results, and progress metrics
4. **SOW Lot Management** - Sub-lot creation and management for splitting SOW items into manufacturing batches

All components follow the layered architecture pattern: UI → Security Middleware → Application Services → Database, ensuring consistent authentication, authorization, and data access patterns throughout the system.

**Key Features:**
- Contract line item management (MTO items)
- Multi-pipe type support (base pipe, mother pipe, pup pipe, centre pipe, coated pipe)
- Manufacturer/vendor assignment per pipe type
- Coating requirement tracking
- Quantity and unit conversion management (PCS, M, MT)
- Price and total cost calculation
- Delivery tolerance configuration
- Inspection requirement configuration per pipe type
- Work order generation and tracking
- Progress monitoring (schedule vs actual)
- SOW splitting into lots for batch processing
