# 5.2 Setup Module

The Setup Module provides master data management and project configuration capabilities. It serves as the foundation for all project operations by defining items, specifications, users, units of measurement, and project-specific settings that are used throughout the system.

**Privilege**: `project.setup.item:R` (read), `project.setup.item:W` (write)

---

### 5.2.3 [Specification Management](5.2-Setup-Module/5.2.3-Specification-Management.md) ⭐
**Critical component** - Defines technical specifications for items (API 5L, ISO 3183, etc.). Specifications are linked to items and used in SOW and Work Orders.

**Key Features:**
- Specification list grouped by type and item type
- Specification creation with technical parameters
- Specification editing and copying
- Specification detail view with usage history

**Privilege**: `project.setup.specification:R` (read), `project.setup.specification:W` (write)

---

### 5.2.4 [Template Sheet](5.2-Setup-Module/5.2.4-Template-Sheet.md)
Manages downloadable Excel template files for inspection data entry across manufacturing and coating activities.

**Privilege**: `project.setup.template_sheet:R`

---

### 5.2.5 [Project Control](5.2-Setup-Module/5.2.5-Project-Control.md)
Configures project-level weighting for progress tracking across SOWs, combinations, and production milestones.

**Key Features:**
- SOW list weight configuration
- SOW combination weight distribution
- Product milestone weight configuration
- Inspection child weight configuration

**Privilege**: `project.setup.project_control:R`

---

### 5.2.6 [Project Setup](5.2-Setup-Module/5.2.6-Project-Setup.md)
Provides a centralized dashboard view of project setup completion across all setup modules.

**Key Features:**
- Setup completion overview for SOW, Work Order, Specification, and Project Control
- Status tracking and navigation to detail pages

**Privilege**: `project.setup.project_setup:R`

---

## Module Dependencies

The Setup Module is foundational and has the following dependencies:

**Depends on:**
- Global Module (5.1) - For authentication and global data

**Required by:**
- SOW Module (5.3) - Requires Item and Specification master data
- Work Order Module (5.4) - Requires Item and Specification master data
- All other project modules - Require user access and project configuration

---

## Security

All Setup components use the same security middleware:

- `auth:api` - Validates JWT token via Laravel Passport
- `project.session:api` - Validates user has access to the project database
- `user.privileges` - Checks component-specific privileges

**Multi-tenancy**: Database routing via `DatabaseAccessMiddleware` switches between:
- **Global DB** - For master data (items, specifications, users)
- **Project DB** - For project-specific configuration (project control, project setup)

---

## Routes

All setup routes are prefixed with `/v2/setup/`:

- `/v2/setup/user` - User Management
- `/v2/setup/item` - Item Management
- `/v2/setup/specification/:type?` - Specification Management
- `/v2/setup/template_sheet` - Template Sheet
- `/v2/setup/project_control` - Project Control
- `/v2/setup` - Project Setup Dashboard
