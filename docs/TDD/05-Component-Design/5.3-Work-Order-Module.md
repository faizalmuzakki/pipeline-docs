# 5.3 Work Order Module

The Work Order Module manages manufacturing orders sent to vendors/mills for production of linepipe and related items. Work orders are created from SOW items and track the manufacturing process from order placement through production completion, including material specifications, quantities, schedules, and vendor assignments.

## Summary

The Work Order Module provides manufacturing order management capabilities across four major components:

1. **Work Order List & Management** - Comprehensive work order listing with filtering by vendor, status, and date range
2. **Work Order Creation & Assignment** - Creation of work orders from SOW items with vendor assignment and scheduling
3. **Work Order Tracking & Status** - Real-time status tracking, progress monitoring, and manufacturing updates
4. **Length History & Heat Management** - Detailed tracking of pipe lengths, heat numbers, and manufacturing batches

All components follow the layered architecture pattern: UI → Security Middleware → Application Services → Database.

**Key Features:**
- SOW-to-Work-Order conversion with quantity allocation
- Multi-vendor work order management
- Manufacturing process tracking (raw material → production → inspection → delivery)
- Length and heat number tracking for traceability
- Work order status management (draft, submitted, in progress, completed, cancelled)
- Vendor performance tracking
- Schedule vs actual progress monitoring
- Work order splitting and merging
- Material certification tracking
