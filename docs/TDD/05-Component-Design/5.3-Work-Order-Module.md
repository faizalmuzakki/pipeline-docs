# 5.3 Work Order Module

The Work Order Module manages manufacturing orders sent to vendors/mills for production of linepipe and related items. Work orders are created from SOW items and track the manufacturing process from order placement through production completion, including material specifications, quantities, schedules, and vendor assignments.

## Summary

The Work Order Module provides manufacturing order management capabilities across four major components:

1. **Work Order Generation & Vendor Tabs** - Automatic WO generation from SOW completion with dynamic vendor tab system for manufacturer/coater-specific views
2. **Length History Tracking** - Detailed production tracking with heat numbers, pipe numbers, length measurements, and photo attachments for quality documentation
3. **Work Order Progress Tracking** - Automatic progress calculation based on length history data with real-time status updates and project-wide progress aggregation
4. **Transfer Tracking Integration** - Automatic transfer tracking initialization linking WO to transfer system for production → coating → shipment flow

All components follow the layered architecture pattern: UI → Security Middleware → Application Services → Database.

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic WO Generation**: Triggered when SOW status = "Completed", creates manufacturing and coating work orders
- **Vendor Tab System**: Dynamic vendor tabs with drag-and-drop reordering, vendor-specific data views, last updated tracking
- **Length History**: Individual pipe tracking (heat no, pipe no, length in meters), photo attachments for quality documentation
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatic progress calculation from length history, real-time status updates, weighted average for project progress
- **Transfer Integration**: Automatic transfer tracking initialization, material flow tracking (production → coating → shipment)
- **Multi-Stage WOs**: Manufacturing stage (production) and coating stage (if applicable) with stage-specific progress
- **Vendor Access**: Vendors can view their assigned work orders (read-only)
- **Heat Number Traceability**: Complete material traceability through heat numbers for quality assurance

**Complexity**: ⚠️ **EXTREMELY HIGH**
