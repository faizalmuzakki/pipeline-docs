# 5.5.5 Transfer Form

## 5.5.5.1 Overview

The Transfer Form allows users to create new transfers or edit existing ones. The form dynamically adjusts based on transfer type (Plane, Ship, Truck, etc) and whether it's a customer pickup scenario.

## 5.5.5.2 User Interface

The form includes sections for transfer information (from location, consignee, transfer type, ETD/ETA dates), cargo selection (work order, lot, item selection, quantity), route information (load out/in ports, vessel details for ship transfers), and remarks. For customer pickup transfers, the form simplifies to show only load out information. Users can add multiple cargos to a single transfer, select items from available work orders and lots, specify quantities within available limits, add route legs with port and vessel information, and save as draft or submit the transfer.
