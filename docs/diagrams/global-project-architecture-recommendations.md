# Global Project Module - Architecture Recommendations

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Strengths
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (UI → Service → Repository → Database)
- ✅ Proper authorization middleware
- ✅ Repository pattern implementation
- ✅ Cross-service communication
- ✅ External system integration (Artisan commands)

### Areas for Enhancement (Optional)

#### 1. Domain Events (If Business Grows Complex)
```php
// Example Domain Events
class ProjectCreated extends DomainEvent
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $projectId,
        public readonly string $projectManagerId,
        public readonly array $projectData
    ) {}
}

class ProjectStatusChanged extends DomainEvent
{
    public function __construct(
        public readonly string $projectId,
        public readonly string $oldStatus,
        public readonly string $newStatus
    ) {}
}
```

#### 2. Domain Services (Extract Complex Logic)
```php
class ProjectValidationService
{
    public function validateProjectCreation(array $data): ValidationResult
    {
        // Extract complex validation logic
        // Check duplicates, business rules, etc.
    }
}

class ProjectAccessControlService  
{
    public function canUserAccessProject(User $user, Project $project): bool
    {
        // Extract role-based access logic
    }
}
```

#### 3. Value Objects (For Complex Data)
```php
class ProjectStatus
{
    const ACTIVE = 'active';
    const CLOSED = 'closed';
    const INCOMPLETE = 'incomplete';
    
    private function __construct(private string $value) {}
    
    public static function fromString(string $status): self
    {
        // Validation logic
        return new self($status);
    }
}
```

## When to Apply These Patterns

### ❌ Don't Over-Engineer If:
- Business logic remains simple CRUD
- No complex state transitions
- No regulatory requirements
- Team prefers simpler patterns

### ✅ Consider Upgrading If:
- Project workflows become complex
- Multiple teams need to integrate
- Audit trails become critical
- Business rules multiply

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Keep Current Layered Architecture
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Project management domain is relatively simple
**Decision**: Maintain current service-repository pattern
**Consequences**: 
- ✅ Easy to understand and maintain
- ✅ Sufficient for current business needs
- ❌ May need refactoring if complexity grows

### ADR-002: Monitor for DDD Upgrade Triggers
**Status**: Proposed
**Context**: Business may evolve to require more complex patterns
**Decision**: Watch for these triggers:
- Complex business rules emerge
- Multiple bounded contexts needed
- Event-driven requirements
- Cross-team integration needs

## Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Current Project Module | Quarantine Module | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Complexity** | Medium | High | Keep current level |
| **Business Rules** | Simple | Complex | Monitor for growth |
| **State Management** | Linear | State Machine | Current approach OK |
| **Integration** | Service calls | Events + Services | Current approach OK |
| **Maintainability** | High | Medium | Maintain simplicity |

## Conclusion

Your current architecture is **appropriately sized** for the domain. The updated flow diagram now accurately reflects the actual complexity while maintaining the right level of abstraction for project management operations.

**Key Takeaway**: Not every module needs to be as complex as the quarantine module. Different domains require different architectural approaches.
