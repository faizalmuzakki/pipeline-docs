5.1.1.1 User Interface
5.1.1.1.1 NCR Form
This is the entry point for submitting a new NCR. Users can select from customer,
vendor, and item options. Upon submission, it sends a token for authentication and
triggers the submit NCR event.
5.1.1.1.2 Detail NCR
This UI is used to view and manage the full lifecycle of a submitted NCR. It supports
actions like assigning owners, submitting actions, and reviewing/commenting. Each
action passes through security and calls specific application services to update the NCR
record.
