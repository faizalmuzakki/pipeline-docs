![NCR - Data Flow Diagram Level 0](NCR-Level-0.png)
This diagram illustrates the Non-Conformance Report (NCR) process, showing how data flows between key roles and the NCR system. The process begins when the Quality & HSE User creates a new NCR. This report is then submitted to the Quality Manager / NCR Manager, who is responsible for reviewing the report, assigning the lead investigator, and approving the NCR.
The Lead Investigator is tasked with reviewing the NCR and providing their approval for task assignment. Once approved, the Action Owner is assigned specific tasks to resolve the non-conformance, and progress is tracked through task verification.
The Acknowledger also plays a role by confirming that the NCR has been acknowledged in the system.
This NCR process ensures systematic handling of non-conformities through defined responsibilities and approvals. It supports traceability and accountability by involving relevant roles in every step—from initial report creation to task completion and acknowledgment—thus maintaining quality standards and regulatory compliance.
